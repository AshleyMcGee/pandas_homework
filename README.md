Heroes of Pymoli

Not entirely sure why my dataframes are displaying as tabular data in code, when they all work just fine offline. Any help I can get with that would be greatly appreciated. 

My written report assumes I was able to get the item price of the most popular and most profitable items into the dataframe. I will be asking for help from a TA to get this to work, though I realize it might be too late to get credit for that portion of the homework.
